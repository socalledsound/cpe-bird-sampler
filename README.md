### bird sampler for the cpe

if you download this repo and copy these files (NOT the enclosing folder) onto a circuit playground express (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express), you'll have yourself a bird sampler.

to turn the included python code into a sampler for your own cpe, all you have to do is replace the sound file names with your own sound file names in the python code, and copy it and your sound files to a CPE.

sound files must be 16 bit 22050khz mono .wav files!
